description: I can thrive and make meaningful contributions in new fields. I offer the resume of an experienced data scientist, but with two bonuses. I combine 5 years of academic physics (particle and space plasma) with 6+ years of business strategy. From working with research professors, post-docs, doctoral candidates to advising C-Suite executives in daily operational business decisions and working directly under directors and VPâ€™s. I have experience ranging from conducting and publishing geophysics research to budgeting multimillion dollar monthly marketing budgets.
