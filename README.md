**Data Scientist @ Spring Venture Group (_2017 - Present_)
Serve as a primary resource for standing up new data science efforts. Defining
requirements, auditing data hygiene, POC modeling, establish documentation standards, and provide reporting/visibility. Provided guidance to C-suite executives for intraday operational adjustments & budgeting. 

- Train, Deploy, & Monitored Prediction Models for:
  - (ML) Prospective revenue for leads to be purchased from marketplace (~$100k/day budget).
  - (non-ML) Auction win likelihood modeling.
  - (ML) Auction frequency for budgeting & configuring bidding model.
  - (ML) Batch predict revenue for prospective lead-to-customer matches for outbound marketing.
  - (ML) Daily business revenue expectations for given operatioal inputs to inform monthly and annual budgeting (~$4,000,000/month marketing budgets).
  - (ML) Likelihood of inbound calls being answered by available agents.

- Co-Design, Monitor, & Maintain Production Services:
  (Python Fast API hosted on AWS EC2, all services configurable)
  (All designed with A/B experimentation capabilities)
  - Bidding model for purchasing leads (spends on order of $10^7 annually).
  - Lead-to-Customer matcher for dialer system.
  - Inbound call accept/reject decider service.
  - Underwriting U.I. for insruance sales agents to suggest best carrier for customer.
